##Sometimes... 
Sometimes it happens that you are wild
And then you are not wild
An era has passed
And whole years are tossed aside
 
And sometimes it happens that you are 
Caught in destiny’s claws
And then you are not
Freed
 
And sometimes you want to be pinned under an enormous and secure weight
So that all thought but breath
Empties itself
