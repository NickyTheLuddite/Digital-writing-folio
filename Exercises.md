###Digital Writing
This first week has revealed a world of digital content I didn't really know existed so I expect my brain will be challenged and stretched in this lab.
###My Writing
I write poetry and fiction; the former is ~~so bloody hard~~ really rewarding when the words arrange in the right order, and the meandering space offered in novel-length fiction is fun to explore. 
Even though I consider myself a Luddite, I use lots of tools -- even my pen and paper is often digital with an iPad and pencil. It's true (for me) that ideas flow better when hand-written; and there's less of a tendency to edit as I write. Scrivener is amazing to easily rearrange and restructure work, and Plottr helps me get the spine of long-form pieces in a visual way.
